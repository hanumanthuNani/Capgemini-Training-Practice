# Day 01 - Learning Notes

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### Java Program Structure
- **Definition:** Every Java program must have a class and a main method
- **Usage:** Entry point for execution
- **Example:**
```java
public class MyProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

### Data Types
- **Definition:** Java has primitive types (int, double, boolean, char) and reference types (String, Arrays, Objects)
- **Usage:** Declare variables to store different kinds of data
- **Example:**
```java
int age = 25;
double salary = 50000.50;
boolean isActive = true;
String name = "John";
```

### System.out.println()
- **Definition:** Method to print output to console
- **Usage:** Display results and debug information
- **Example:**
```java
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
```

## 💡 Tips & Tricks
- Class name must match the filename
- Java is case-sensitive
- Every statement ends with a semicolon (;)
- Use meaningful variable names

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes
- Forgetting semicolons at the end of statements
- Mismatching class name and filename
- Not handling division by zero in arithmetic operations

## 🔍 Things to Remember
- Java follows PascalCase for class names
- Use camelCase for method and variable names
- main method signature must be exact: `public static void main(String[] args)`
