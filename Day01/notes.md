### Key Learnings

- `Scanner.hasNextInt()` must be used before `nextInt()` to avoid input mismatch errors
- `char` comparisons should use character literals like `'A'`, `'a'`, `'0'` instead of numeric values
- Zero is neither positive nor negative
- Use `int` for money-related calculations instead of `float` to avoid precision issues
- Ternary operator is useful for simple conditional checks
- `if-else` and `else-if` statements help in decision-making and handling multiple conditions
- Menu-driven programs improve logical thinking and real-world problem solving
