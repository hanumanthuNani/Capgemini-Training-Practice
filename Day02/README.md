# Day 02 – Control Flow Practice (Java)

## 📌 Overview
This day focuses on strengthening **control flow logic** in Java using:
- if–else statements
- switch cases
- loops
- basic input validation

The programs are designed to improve decision-making and conditional thinking,
which are essential for real-world programming and interviews.
