# Day 02 – Control Flow Notes

## 1️⃣ What is Control Flow?
Control flow decides **which statement executes** and **how many times**.
Java provides:
- if / else
- switch
- loops

---

## 2️⃣ if–else Usage
Used when decisions depend on conditions.

Example:
if (marks >= 40) → Pass  
else → Fail

Key points:
- Conditions must return boolean
- Order matters in else-if ladder

---

## 3️⃣ switch Statement
Used when checking **fixed values**.

Best for:
- menu driven programs
- days, grades, roles

Rules:
- case values must be constant
- break prevents fall-through
- default executes when no case matches

---

## 4️⃣ ASCII Concept
Every character has a numeric ASCII value.

Example:
'A' → 65  
'a' → 97  
'0' → 48  

Casting char to int gives ASCII value.

---

## 5️⃣ Vowel vs Consonant Logic
Check:
- character range (A–Z / a–z)
- vowel list (a, e, i, o, u)

---

## 6️⃣ Natural Numbers
Natural numbers start from 1.

Common operations:
- sum of N numbers
- counting
- range-based logic

---

## 7️⃣ Loops Used Today
Mostly used:
- for loop → known range
- while loop → condition-based repetition

---

## 8️⃣ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Missing break in switch
- Wrong condition order in if–else
- Infinite loops
- Using = instead of == in conditions

---

## 9️⃣ Key Takeaway
Java syntax is secondary.
**Logical thinking and flow control are primary.**

Once logic is clear, syntax becomes easy.
