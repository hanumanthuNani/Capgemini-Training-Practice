# Capgemini Training Practice

This repository contains daily coding practice problems solved during Capgemini training using Java.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each day's work is organized in its own directory following this structure:

```
DayXX/
├── README.md        # Problem statements and descriptions
├── src/             # Java source code solutions
│   └── *.java
└── notes.md         # Daily learnings and notes
```

## 🚀 How to Add a New Day

1. **Copy the template directory:**
   ```bash
   cp -r templates/DayTemplate DayXX
   ```
   Replace `XX` with the day number (e.g., Day01, Day02, Day15)

2. **Update the Day README:**
   - Add problem statements
   - Include problem descriptions and constraints
   - Add any relevant links or resources

3. **Write your solutions:**
   - Create Java files in the `src/` directory
   - Follow Java naming conventions (PascalCase for class names)
   - Add proper comments and documentation

4. **Document your learnings:**
   - Update `notes.md` with key concepts learned
   - Add any tips, tricks, or gotchas discovered
   - Include references to documentation or articles

## 📚 Daily Progress

- [Day01](Day01/) - Introduction to Java basics
- [Day02](Day02/) - Control structures and loops

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup

- **Language**: Java (JDK 8 or higher recommended)
- **IDE**: Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)
- **Build**: Compile and run using `javac` and `java` commands

### Compilation Example
```bash
cd DayXX/src
javac ProblemName.java
java ProblemName
```

## 📝 Naming Conventions

- **Directories**: `DayXX` (e.g., Day01, Day02, Day15)
- **Java Files**: PascalCase (e.g., `HelloWorld.java`, `ArraySum.java`)
- **Package Names**: lowercase (if using packages)
