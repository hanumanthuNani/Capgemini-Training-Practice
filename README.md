# Capgemini Training Practice

This repository documents my **daily coding practice during Capgemini training**, primarily using **Java**.  
It serves as a structured learning log to track problem-solving progress, concepts learned, and hands-on practice over time.

The goal of this repository is **consistency**, **concept clarity**, and **progressive improvement**, rather than building a single application.

---

## 📁 Repository Organization

The repository is organized **day-wise**, where each day represents the problems practiced and concepts covered during training.

```

DayXX/
├── README.md        # Problems practiced on that day
├── src/             # Java solutions
└── notes.md         # Key learnings, mistakes, and observations

```

Each day is self-contained and can be reviewed independently.

## 📚 Daily Practice Log

- **Day01** – Java basics, syntax, and primitive data types  
- **Day02** – Control flow statements and looping constructs  

(Upcoming days will continue as training progresses.)

---

## 🧠 What This Repository Shows

- Regular **problem-solving practice**
- Gradual progression from basics to advanced topics
- Clear documentation of **learnings and mistakes**
- Clean and organized Java code
- Consistency in daily learning habits

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java  
- **Tools**: Standard Java compiler (`javac`) and runtime (`java`)  
- **Environment**: Any Java-supported IDE or editor

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository acts as:
- A **personal learning journal**
- A **reference for revision**
- A **portfolio of training-level problem solving**

It reflects my learning journey during Capgemini training rather than a production-ready software project.
